# Final Report : Neural Networks Clustering [GSA&ER]

This study analyzed pollution and energy data across countries using preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and supervised learning. KMeans and Agglomerative clustering grouped countries with similar profiles, showing cluster-wise energy recovery (e.g., KMeans Cluster 0: 276.99 GWh). Neural network regression performed poorly (initial R² = -1.15, MSE = 51,961.44, MAE = 190.35; improved R² = -1.32, MSE = 56,200.59, MAE = 193.05), while linear regression outperformed it (R² = -0.11, MSE = 26,799.65, MAE = 145.19), indicating linear relationships dominate. Recommendations include investing in renewable energy, stricter waste regulations, cluster-based policy interventions, regional cooperation, and continuous monitoring to improve energy recovery.
