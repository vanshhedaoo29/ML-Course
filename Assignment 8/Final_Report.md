# Final Report: CNN, Apriori, Evaluation & Validation [GSA&ER]

## Summary

This assignment applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Apriori association rule mining to analyze pollution severity and energy recovery, with categorical features encoded and numerical features normalized. Frequent itemsets and rules showed moderate support (0.1â€“0.5), confidence, and lift (>1.0), indicating meaningful associations. High pollution regions often co-occurred with medium/high energy recovery. CNNs were discussed for delivery prediction, offering high accuracy (~0.78) but lower interpretability, whereas Apriori provided explicit, interpretable rules. Recommendations include targeted interventions in high-pollution areas, adopting efficient energy recovery technologies, policy prioritization using rule metrics, continuous monitoring, and integrating deep learning and rule-based insights for holistic environmental and logistics strategies.
