# Final Report: Global Pollution & Energy Recovery Analysis

## 1. Methodologies

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Used `SimpleImputer` (mean strategy) for numerical columns.
- **Normalization:** Applied `MinMaxScaler` to pollution indices (`Air_Pollution_Index`, `Water_Pollution_Index`, `Soil_Pollution_Index`).
- **Categorical Encoding:** Used `LabelEncoder` for categorical features (`Country`, `Year`).

### Feature Engineering
- **Energy Consumption per Capita:** Used or derived from total energy and population.
- **Pollution Trends:** Analyzed correlation between pollution indices and energy recovery over years.
- **Pollution Severity Categorization:** Classified pollution indices into `Low`, `Medium`, `High` using defined thresholds.

### Association Rule Mining (Apriori)
- **Discretization:** Converted energy columns into categorical bins (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) using quantiles.
- **One-hot Encoding:** Prepared data for Apriori algorithm.
- **Frequent Itemsets & Rules:** Mined frequent itemsets and association rules using `mlxtend`'s `apriori` and `association_rules`.

### Evaluation
- **Rule Filtering:** Focused on rules linking high pollution severity and energy recovery categories.
- **Metrics:** Evaluated rules using support, confidence, lift, leverage, conviction, and other metrics.
- **Train-Test Split:** Assessed rule accuracy on held-out test data.

### Visualization
- **Frequent Itemsets:** Bar plot of top itemsets by support.
- **Association Rules:** Network graph of top rules by lift.
- **Metric Distributions:** Histograms for lift, confidence, and support.

### Model Comparison
- **CNN (Hypothetical):** Discussed CNNs for delivery prediction (image-based).
- **Apriori:** Compared with rule-based mining for tabular/categorical data.

## 2. Evaluation & Insights

### Effectiveness of Apriori
- **Lift & Confidence:** Most rules show moderate lift (>1.0) and confidence, indicating meaningful associations.
- **Support:** Frequent itemsets and rules have support values typically between 0.1 and 0.5, showing recurring patterns.
- **Rule Accuracy:** Evaluated on test set; accuracy indicates practical predictive value.

### Key Insights
- **High Pollution & Energy Recovery:** High air/water pollution levels often co-occur with medium/high energy recovery.
- **Severity Patterns:** Regions with high pollution severity tend to have higher energy recovery activities.
- **Inter-feature Relationships:** Pollution severity and energy recovery categories are strongly associated, suggesting targeted interventions.

### Model Comparison
| Aspect           | CNN (Hypothetical)         | Apriori (Implemented)           |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Data Type        | Image/Spatial Data         | Categorical/Tabular Data        |
| Interpretability | Low (black-box)            | High (explicit rules)           |
| Scalability      | High (resource-intensive)  | Moderate (depends on data size) |
| Effectiveness    | High for image tasks       | High for pattern discovery      |
| Use Case         | Delivery prediction        | Association rule mining         |

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

### Pollution Control Strategies
- **Targeted Interventions:** Focus on regions/periods where rules indicate strong links between pollution and energy recovery.
- **Technology Adoption:** Promote high-efficiency energy recovery in high-pollution areas.
- **Policy Guidance:** Use support, confidence, and lift metrics to prioritize impactful rules for policy action.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Mine new rules as data evolves to guide adaptive strategies.

### Delivery Prediction (CNN, if applicable)
- **Image Data Utilization:** Use CNNs for spatial/image-based delivery prediction.
- **Feature Integration:** Combine CNN outputs with tabular features for enhanced accuracy.
- **Model Retraining:** Regularly update models with new data.

### General Recommendations
- **Renewable Energy:** Encourage adoption to mitigate pollution indices.
- **Efficient Waste Management:** Implement policies for better waste-to-energy conversion.
- **Holistic Decision-Making:** Integrate insights from both rule-based and deep learning models for comprehensive strategies.
