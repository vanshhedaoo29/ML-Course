# Final Report: Naive Bayes, (KNN), Decision Tree [GSA&ER]

## Summary

The dataset of 200 country-year records included air, water, and soil pollution indices, industrial/plastic waste, energy consumption, COâ‚‚ emissions, and socio-economic indicators. A composite `Total_Pollution_Index` was created and countries were categorized into Low, Medium, and High pollution severity. Model evaluations showed Decision Tree achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 0.975, precision = 0.977, recall = 0.975, F1 = 0.975), KNN performed well (accuracy = 0.900, precision = 0.903, recall = 0.900, F1 = 0.901), while MultinomialNB lagged (accuracy = 0.575, precision = 0.605, recall = 0.575, F1 = 0.575). Feature importance highlighted `Total_Pollution_Index` as key, leading to recommendations for integrated pollution management, stricter air quality regulations, cross-sector collaboration, and continuous monitoring.
