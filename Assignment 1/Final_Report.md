# Food Delivery Time Prediction - Final Report

## Summary

This project analyzed 200 food delivery records using preprocessing and predictive modeling. Linear regression with distance, traffic, and order priority showed low predictive strength (RÂ² = 0.0149, MAE = 25.37, MSE = 905.09). Logistic regression with traffic, weather, and experience performed moderately (accuracy = 0.38, precision = 0.31, recall = 0.26, F1 = 0.29, ROC AUC = 0.34), limited by class imbalance. Findings highlight distance, traffic, and staff experience as key factors. Recommendations include route optimization, peak-hour staffing, staff training, and continuous monitoring to reduce delays, improve efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.
