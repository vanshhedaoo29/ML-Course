#  Final Report: CNN, Apriori, Evaluation & Validation [FDTP]

## Summary

This assignment predicted food delivery time using feature engineering and machine learning, comparing CNN and Logistic Regression. Preprocessing included missing value imputation, one-hot encoding, scaling, and creating features such as Haversine distance, Rush Hour, and Weather Impact. CNN achieved superior performance with accuracy = 0.78, precision = 0.77, recall = 0.75, F1-score = 0.76, and AUC ≈ 0.82, outperforming Logistic Regression (accuracy = 0.70, precision = 0.68, recall = 0.67, F1-score = 0.67, AUC ≈ 0.74). CNN effectively captured nonlinear relationships, making it the recommended model, while Logistic Regression served as a stable baseline.
