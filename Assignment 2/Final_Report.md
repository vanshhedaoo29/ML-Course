# Final Report: Global Pollution Analysis

## Key Findings

- **Pollution Trends:**  
    - Air, water, and soil pollution indices show significant variation across countries and years.
    - Some countries consistently exhibit high air pollution (e.g., Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Ukraine, Colombia, Belgium).
    - Yearly trends indicate fluctuations in average pollution indices and energy recovery, with no consistent upward or downward trend.

- **Energy Recovery:**  
    - Average energy recovered varies widely by country and pollution severity.
    - Countries with high pollution do not always achieve high energy recovery, indicating potential inefficiencies or lack of infrastructure.

- **Correlation Insights:**  
    - Strong correlations exist between pollution indices and industrial waste/CO₂ emissions.
    - Energy consumption per capita is moderately correlated with pollution indices.

## Model Evaluations

- **Linear Regression (Predicting Energy Recovery):**
    - $R^2$: -0.025 (poor fit, model does not explain variance well)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 24792.81
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 142.11

- **Logistic Regression (Classifying Pollution Severity):**
    - Accuracy: 0.950
    - Precision: 0.956
    - Recall: 0.950
    - F1-score: 0.949

    The classification model performs well, indicating that pollution severity can be reliably predicted from air pollution and CO₂ emissions.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Targeted Interventions:**  
     Focus on countries with high air pollution but below-median energy recovery (e.g., Bolivia, Cambodia, Colombia, Congo, Ukraine, Zimbabwe). These countries could benefit most from improved waste-to-energy infrastructure.

2. **Technology Investment:**  
     Invest in advanced waste-to-energy technologies to convert more waste into usable energy, especially in the identified countries.

3. **Policy and Regulation:**  
     Implement stricter regulations and incentives for industrial emission reductions and cleaner production processes.

4. **Promote Renewables:**  
     Encourage adoption of renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency in industrial and residential sectors.

5. **Circular Economy:**  
     Promote recycling and circular economy practices to reduce waste generation and resource consumption.

6. **Public Awareness:**  
     Enhance public awareness and education on pollution prevention and sustainable energy use.

7. **Monitoring and Reporting:**  
     Strengthen monitoring and reporting systems for pollution and energy recovery to track progress and identify further opportunities for improvement.
