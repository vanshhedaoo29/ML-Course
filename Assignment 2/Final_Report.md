# Final Report: Global Pollution Analysis

## Summary

This global pollution analysis shows wide variation in air, water, and soil pollution across countries, with high levels in Equatorial Guinea, Congo, and Ukraine. Energy recovery is inconsistent and often unrelated to pollution severity, while pollution strongly correlates with industrial waste and CO₂ emissions. Linear regression performed poorly in predicting energy recovery (R² = -0.025, MSE = 24792.81, MAE = 142.11), whereas logistic regression classified pollution severity effectively (accuracy = 0.950, precision = 0.956, recall = 0.950, F1 = 0.949). Recommendations include waste-to-energy investment, stricter policies, renewable adoption, circular economy practices, public awareness, and stronger monitoring.
