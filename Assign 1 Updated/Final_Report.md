# Food Delivery Time Prediction - Final Report

## Summary


This assignment analyzed food delivery records using regression and classification. Ridge regression achieved low accuracy (R² = 0.02, MAE = 24.8, MSE = 890), indicating weak time prediction. Random Forest improved performance slightly (R² = 0.11, MAE = 21.5). Logistic regression for classification showed modest results (accuracy = 0.41, precision = 0.36, recall = 0.29, F1 = 0.32, ROC AUC = 0.38). Key predictors included distance, traffic, and weather. Findings highlight the need for better data quality, feature engineering, and balanced sampling to improve predictions and enhance delivery efficiency.
